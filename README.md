## 📊 Vehicle Clustering with KMeans

This project demonstrates how to apply **KMeans clustering** to a synthetic dataset representing vehicle attributes such as **Weight**, **Engine Size**, and **Horsepower**.
It uses unsupervised learning to group vehicles into clusters based on their similarities without any prior labels.

### 🚗 Features

* Synthetic dataset generation for vehicle specifications
* KMeans clustering using **scikit-learn**
* Visualization of clustered data using **Matplotlib**
* Clean and beginner-friendly code

### 🧪 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Pandas 📊
* NumPy 🔢
* Matplotlib 📈
* scikit-learn 🤖
